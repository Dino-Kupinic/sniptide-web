# Sniptide website

The marketing site for [Sniptide](https://github.com/Dino-Kupinic/sniptide), served at
sniptide.com. It's a small Next.js 16 app that shares its components and theme with the app through
the [`@sniptide/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sniptide/ui) package.

Self-hosted Sniptide instances don't need this repo: the app works on its own.

## Setup

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local   # points the sign-in and paste links at a local app
bun dev                      # http://localhost:3001
```

## Shared UI

Components (`Button`, `Logo`, `Stripes`, …) and the theme come from `@sniptide/ui`, which lives in
`packages/ui` of the app repo and is published to npm. To use a new component or style change,
release a new version there, then bump it here:

```bash
bun update @sniptide/ui
```

## Deploy

Coolify builds the `Dockerfile` from `main` (port `3000`, health check `GET /`) and serves it at
`https://sniptide.com`. The app runs separately at `https://app.sniptide.com`.

sniptide.com is shared with the app in two ways (`next.config.ts`):

- **Share links stay on sniptide.com.** Any path without a page here (`/k7Qe2x`, `/k7Qe2x/raw`,
  `POST /k7Qe2x/reveal`, the app's `/_next/*` assets those pages load) is proxied to the app, so
  the address bar keeps sniptide.com. This site's own assets live under `/_site` so they never
  collide with the app's. A burn-after-read paste is consumed only by that POST. Every other
  method on `/<slug>/reveal` is `405` with `Allow: POST`. Known preview bots, and posts whose
  `Sec-Fetch-Site` is `cross-site`, are `403`. None of those are forwarded.
- **App pages redirect.** `/sign-in`, `/dashboard`, `/new`, `/settings`, … and `/api/auth/*` get a
  308 to the same path on app.sniptide.com. Add new app sections to `appPages` there.

The app needs `SHARE_URL=https://sniptide.com` so its dashboard copies sniptide.com links.

The root page (`/`) sends visitors to the app dashboard only after the app validates their session.
Logged-out visitors, stale cookies, and failed session checks show marketing instead. Session
checks are uncached and time out after three seconds. `/home` always shows marketing, even when
signed in, and never contacts the app. The marketing logo links there so browsing the site doesn't
send signed-in visitors back to the dashboard.

On a proxied request the app would otherwise see this site's address. Set `SHARE_PROXY_SECRET` to
the same value on both apps and each proxied request includes `X-Sniptide-Client-IP` and
`X-Sniptide-Proxy-Secret`. The app checks the secret and trusts that address. When the secret is
unset, or no visitor address is available, neither header is sent. A visitor cannot supply them.

`CLIENT_IP_HEADER` names the incoming header the address is read from. Leave it unset to use the
last hop of `X-Forwarded-For`, which is what a single reverse proxy appends, so a self-hosted site
needs nothing else. If the chosen header is missing, no address is forwarded.

Build-time setting: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, where buttons, redirects and the proxy point. Defaults
to `https://app.sniptide.com`. `SHARE_PROXY_SECRET` and `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` are read at runtime.

### Analytics

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` (and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` for EU cloud) as build variables to
send pageviews and button clicks to PostHog. It runs cookieless, so there is no consent banner,
which needs **Cookieless server hash mode** turned on in the PostHog project settings. Requests go
through `/_site/ph` on this site so ad blockers don't drop them. The app reports to the same
project; filter on the `surface` property (`marketing` or `app`). Without a key nothing loads.

Button and link clicks are also sent as `cta_clicked` with `location` (the section: `header`, `hero`,
`features`, `analytics`, `raw-links`, `cta` or `footer`, set with `data-cta-location`) and `target`
(`sign_up`, `sign_in`, `new_paste`, `dashboard`, `import_gist` or `anchor`). Funnels should use this
event rather than autocapture selectors.
